### `WELCOME DUELIST` ###

This is a very short project that has been developed in less than a week! 

There are still many, many details that have to be improved and added in this short time, one of them is the rendering of the API, sometimes it just does not update on time, but if you click in the pagination twice it will change in case that occurs.

Even tho, it is a perfect opportunity to explore, practice, and learn new technologies and programming things like coding a document 

Inside every component there's documentation in case the code was difficult to understand, or read or de interaction between some of them looks unclear or confusing.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start or yarn start`

## How to Interact as a User.

There are 3 different parts inside of the screen that has an effect depending on the user's behavior.

1- You can select the number of cards that will appear inside the left option below the title by using your mouse or your keyboard.
2- You can choose and click one of the 10 different pages that offer the pagination upside and downside of the screen that will show you the number of cards that you had selected.
3- You can change the way the information is provided by clicking the button "Change View".

## Thanks for your attention ‚≠ê

I have no more time left, haha.
